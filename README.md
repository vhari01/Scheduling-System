# Hospital Appointment System 

## Fetches data from patients and manages appointment and more

List of things I expect the program to do:
- As a user, I should be able to assign myself a seriousness level so that I can get a priority during my appoitment
- As a user, I want to be able to add my name, age, name of the insurance that I have.
- As a user, I want the application to assign me a specialist depending on the medical problem that I have.
- As a user, I want tot be able to reschedule or cancel an appointment
- The application

**The application that I am expecting to make can be used in Hospital and medical facilities to keep better track of the patients and manage them in an efficient manner. It should put the patients in a list and use queue to prioritize them depending on the seriousness of the illness. After that it should treat the patients depending on their sequence in the queue. I was thinking of using a priority queue to achieve this goal**

*I came up with the idea for a hospital appointment system after seeing how difficult it can be for patients to manage their appointments, especially in busy hospitals. A family member once had to wait for hours due to a scheduling mix-up, and it made me realize how much smoother things could be with better coordination. I wanted to create something that could help hospitals streamline the process and make it easier for patients to book, reschedule, and manage their appointments without the stress.*
